Searcher
========

Searcher (better name pending) is a replacement for the CoverSutra search window.
It quickly allows you to search for and play that song you've been thinking about without taking your hands off the keyboard.

Usage
=====

Currently, Searcher is built to be launched with the hard-coded keyboard shortcut `cmd+shift+space`.
It will sit patiently in the Dock, and gets out of your way once you chosen a song.
